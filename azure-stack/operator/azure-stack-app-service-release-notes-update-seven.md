  - As of this release Users can configure Access Restrictions for their Web/Api/Functions applications according to the documentation published - [Azure App Service Access Restrictions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions), **NOTE**: Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub does not support Service Endpoints.

- **Windows Update Behavior**:
  Based on customer feedback we have changed the way in which Windows Update is configured on App Service roles from Update 7:
  - Three modes:
    - **Disabled** - Windows Update service disabled, Windows will be updated with the KB that is shipped with Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub releases;
    - **Automatic** - Windows Update service enabled and Windows Update will determine how and when to update;
    - **Managed** - Windows Update service is disabled, Azure App Service will perform a Windows Update cycle during OnStart of the individual role.

  **New** Deployments - Windows Update service is disabled by default.

  **Existing** Deployments - If you have modified the setting on the Controller, the value will now change from **False** to **Disabled** and a previous value of **true** will become **Automatic**

### Post-deployment steps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have provided the App Service resource provider with a SQL Always On Instance you MUST [add the appservice_hosting and appservice_metering databases to an availability group](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-add-a-database) and synchronize the databases to prevent any loss of service in the event of a database failover.

### Known issues (post-installation)

- Workers are unable to reach file server when App Service is deployed in an existing virtual network and the file server is only available on the private network,  as called out in the Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub deployment documentation.

If you chose to deploy into an existing virtual network and an internal IP address to connect to your file server, you must add an outbound security rule, enabling SMB traffic between the worker subnet and the file server. Go to the WorkersNsg in the Admin Portal and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:
 * Source: Any
 * Source port range: *
 * Destination: IP Addresses
 * Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your file server
 * Destination port range: 445
 * Protocol: TCP
 * Action: Allow
 * Priority: 700
 * Name: Outbound_Allow_SMB445

### Known issues for Cloud Admins operating Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub

Refer to the documentation in the [Azure Stack Hub 1907 Release Notes](azure-stack-release-notes-1907.md)
