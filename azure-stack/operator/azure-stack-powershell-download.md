# Download Azure Stack Hub tools from GitHub

**AzureStack-Tools** is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools) that hosts PowerShell modules for managing and deploying resources to Azure Stack Hub. If you're planning to establish VPN connectivity, you can download these PowerShell modules to the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK), or to a Windows-based external client. To get these tools, clone the GitHub repository or download the **AzureStack-Tools** folder by running the following script:

```powershell
# Change directory to the root directory.
cd \

# Download the tools archive.
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 
invoke-webrequest `
  https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/archive/master.zip `
  -OutFile master.zip

# Expand the downloaded files.
expand-archive master.zip `
  -DestinationPath . `
  -Force

# Change to the tools directory.
cd AzureStack-Tools-master

```
