# App Service on Azure Stack Hub update 6 release notes

These release notes describe the improvements and fixes in Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub Update 6 and any known issues. Known issues are divided into issues directly related to the deployment, update process, and issues with the build (post-installation).

> [!IMPORTANT]

### Post-deployment Steps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have provided the App Service resource provider with a SQL Always On Instance you MUST [add the appservice_hosting and appservice_metering databases to an availability group](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-add-a-database) and synchronize the databases to prevent any loss of service in the event of a database failover.

### Known issues (post-installation)

- Workers are unable to reach file server when App Service is deployed in an existing virtual network and the file server is only available on the private network,  as called out in the Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub deployment documentation.

If you chose to deploy into an existing virtual network and an internal IP address to connect to your file server, you must add an outbound security rule, enabling SMB traffic between the worker subnet and the file server. Go to the WorkersNsg in the Admin Portal and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:
 * Source: Any
 * Source port range: *
 * Destination: IP Addresses
 * Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your file server
 * Destination port range: 445
 * Protocol: TCP
 * Action: Allow
 * Priority: 700
 * Name: Outbound_Allow_SMB445

### Known issues for Cloud Admins operating Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub

Refer to the documentation in the [Azure Stack Hub 1908 Release Notes](/azure-stack/operator/release-notes?view=azs-1908)

### Known issues for Tenants deploying applications on Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub

- Deployment Center is greyed out

Tenants cannot yet make use of Deployment Center, which is a feature that was released in the public cloud in late 2018.  Tenants can still use the standard deployment methods (FTP, Web Deploy, Git, etc.) via the portal, CLI, and PowerShell.

- Deployment options (Classic) UX and Deployment credentials portal options not available

In order to reach the deployment options and deployment credentials user experiences in the Azure Stack Hub deployment, tenants should access the portal using this URL format - https://portal.&lt;*region*&gt;.&lt;*FQDN*&gt;/?websitesExtension_oldvsts=true - which, for the ASDK would be [https://portal.local.azurestack.external/?websitesExtension_oldvsts=true](https://portal.local.azurestack.external/?websitesExtension_oldvsts=true) , and then navigate to their applications normally.

- Azure Function Monitoring continually shows "Loading" in the portal

When you attempt to monitor individual Functions, in the user portal, you will see no invocation log, success count, or error count.  To re-enable this functionality, go to your **Function App**, go to **Platform Features**, and go to **Application settings**.  Add a new app setting - name **AzureWebJobsDashboard** and set the value to the same value as set in AzureWebJobsStorage.  Then go to the Monitor view on your function and you will see the monitoring information.
