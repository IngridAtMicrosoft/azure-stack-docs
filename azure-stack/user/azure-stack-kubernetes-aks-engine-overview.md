# What is the AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub?

You can use the AKS engine command-line tool to deploy and manage a Kubernetes cluster on Azure and Azure Stack Hub. Use the AKS engine to create, upgrade, and scale Azure Resource Manager native clusters. You can use the engine to deploy a cluster in both connected and disconnected environments. This article provides an overview of the AKS engine, supported scenarios for using the engine with Azure Stack Hub, and an introduction to operations such as deploy, upgrade, and scale.

## Overview of the AKS engine

The [AKS engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine) provides a command-line tool to bootstrap Kubernetes clusters on Azure and Azure Stack Hub. By using the Azure Resource Manager, the AKS engine helps you create and maintain clusters running on VMs, virtual networks, and other infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) resources in Azure Stack Hub.

## AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub considerations

Before you use the AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub, it's important to understand the differences between Azure Stack Hub and Azure. This section identifies different features and key considerations when using Azure Stack Hub with the AKS engine to manage your Kubernetes cluster.

For more information on the specifics of the AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub and its differences with respect to Azure see [AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/blob/master/docs/topics/azure-stack.md).

## Supported scenarios with the AKS engine

The following scenarios are supported by the Azure Stack Hub support team:

1.  AKS engine deploys all cluster artifacts following the guidelines in this documentation and using the [following template](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/tree/master/examples/azure-stack).
2.  AKS engine deploys the cluster on an existing VNET. For more information, see [Using a custom virtual network with AKS engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/blob/master/docs/tutorials/custom-vnet.md).
3.  [Upgrade](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-upgrade.md) and [scale](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-scale.md) operations.

For more information on the AKS engine and Azure Stack Hub, see [Support policies for AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-support.md).

## Install the AKS engine and deploy a Kubernetes cluster

To deploy a Kubernetes cluster with the AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub:

1. [Set up the prerequisites for the AKS engine](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-set-up.md)
2. Install the AKS engine to a machine with access to your Azure Stack Hub environment.
     - [Install the AKS engine on Windows in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-deploy-windows.md)
     - [Install the AKS engine on Linux in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-deploy-linux.md)
3. [Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with the AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-deploy-cluster.md)
