# Deploy foundational patterns overview


Each of these patterns contains guidance, Azure Resource Manager templates, and tutorials. You can use these patterns along with third-party apps to create offerings not yet supported by Azure Stack. For example, operators often deal with the complexities involved in setting up a virtual private network (VPN) to a single Azure Stack Hub instance, much less creating a VPN that spans two or more environments. Operators can come across issues when trying to create a load balancer in front of an Azure Stack Hub to manage workloads. With the following guidance, you can speed up the deployment time for releasing your production ready workloads.

## Networking

Use the networking patterns to find instructions on creating virtual network peering with Azure Stack Hub. Virtual network peering allows you to connect two virtual networks so that they appear as a single network. Site-to-site connectivity across virtual networks is accomplished through the Remote and Routing Service (RRAS). RRAS allows for Windows virtual machines (VM) to work as routers. With these scripts, you can deploy two virtual networks across resource groups in one Azure Stack Hub resource group, across subscriptions, and across two Azure Stack Hub instances. You can deploy the scripts on Azure Stack Hub and on global Azure. 

Each article addresses common consideration such as: 
- Scale
- Bandwidth
- Security
- Business continuity

## Storage

Use the storage patterns to increase your storage options with Azure Stack Hub. In Azure Stack Hub storage is finite. Connect to resources in your existing datacenter. Find instructions for creating a Windows VM in Azure Stack Hub to connect to an external iSCSI target. You can learn how to enable key features such as Multipath I/O (MPIO), to optimize performance and connectivity between the VM and external storage.

## Backup

You can use the backup and disaster recovery patterns to copy all the resources in a subscription to Azure or another Azure Stack Hub instance. These patterns look at using Commvault live-sync to replicate information stored on the inside of the VMs to another environment. You can find scripts to create a storage account and a backup storage account to send the data. With the module Azure subscription replicator you can orchestrate resource replication, and you can customize the processor to handle a variety of resources.
