# Use API version profiles with Ruby in Azure Stack Hub

## Ruby and API version profiles

The Ruby SDK for the Azure Stack Hub Resource Manager provides tools to help you build and manage your infrastructure. Resource providers in the SDK include Compute, Virtual Networks, and Storage, with the Ruby language. API profiles in the Ruby SDK enable hybrid cloud development by helping you switch between global Azure resources and resources on Azure Stack Hub.

An API profile is a combination of resource providers and service versions. You can use an API profile to combine different resource types.

- To use the latest versions of all the services, use the **Latest** profile of the Azure SDK rollup gem.
- To use the services compatible with the Azure Stack Hub, use the **V2019_03_01_Hybrid** or **V2018_03_01** profile of the Azure SDK rollup gem.
- To use the latest **api-version** of a service, use the **Latest** profile of the specific gem. For example, to use the latest **api-version** of compute service alone, use the **Latest** profile of the **Compute** gem.
- To use a specific **api-version** for a service, use the specific API versions defined inside the gem.

> [!NOTE]
> You can combine all of the options in the same app.

## Install the Azure Ruby SDK

- Follow the official instructions to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- Follow the official instructions to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
  - When installing, choose **Add Ruby to PATH variable**.
  - When prompted during Ruby installation, install the development kit.
  - Next, install the bundler using the following command: 

       ```Ruby
       Gem install bundler
       ```

- If not available, create a subscription and save the subscription ID to be used later. Instructions to create a subscription are in the [Create subscriptions to offers in Azure Stack Hub](../operator/azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm.md) article.
- Create a service principal and save its ID and secret. Instructions to create a service principal for Azure Stack Hub are in the [Use an app identity to access resources](../operator/azure-stack-create-service-principals.md) article.
- Make sure your service principal has the contributor/owner role assigned on your subscription. Instructions on how to assign a role to a service principal are in the [Use an app identity to access resources](../operator/azure-stack-create-service-principals.md).

## Install the RubyGem packages

You can install the Azure RubyGem packages directly.

```Ruby  
gem install azure_mgmt_compute
gem install azure_mgmt_storage
gem install azure_mgmt_resources
gem install azure_mgmt_network
```

Or, use them in your Gemfile.

```Ruby
gem 'azure_mgmt_storage'
gem 'azure_mgmt_compute'
gem 'azure_mgmt_resources'
gem 'azure_mgmt_network'
```

The Azure Resource Manager Ruby SDK is in preview and will likely have breaking interface changes in upcoming releases. An increased number in the minor version may indicate breaking changes.

## Use the azure_sdk gem

The **azure_sdk** gem is a rollup of all the supported gems in the Ruby SDK. This gem consists of a **Latest** profile, which supports the latest version of all services. It includes versioned profiles **V2017_03_09** and **V2019_03_01_Hybrid**, which are built for Azure Stack Hub.

You can install the azure_sdk rollup gem with the following command:  

```Ruby  
gem install 'azure_sdk'
```

## Prerequisites

To use the Ruby Azure SDK with Azure Stack Hub, you must supply the following values, and then set the values with environment variables. To set the environmental variables, see the instructions following the table for your specific operating system.

| Value | Environment variables | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tenant ID | `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Your Azure Stack Hub [tenant ID](../operator/azure-stack-identity-overview.md). |
| Client ID | `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | The service principal app ID saved when the service principal was created in the previous section of this article.  |
| Subscription ID | `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | You use the [subscription ID](../operator/service-plan-offer-subscription-overview.md#subscriptions) to access offers in Azure Stack Hub. |
| Client Secret | `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | The service principal app secret saved when the service principal was created. |
| Resource Manager Endpoint | `ARM_ENDPOINT` | See [The Azure Stack Hub Resource Manager endpoint](#the-azure-stack-hub-resource-manager-endpoint).  |

### The Azure Stack Hub Resource Manager endpoint

The Microsoft Azure Resource Manager is a management framework that allows admins to deploy, manage, and monitor Azure resources. Azure Resource Manager can handle these tasks as a group, rather than individually, in a single operation.

You can get the metadata info from the Resource Manager endpoint. The endpoint returns a JSON file with the info required to run your code.

 > [!NOTE]  
 > The **ResourceManagerUrl** in the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) is: `https://management.local.azurestack.external/`
 > The **ResourceManagerUrl** in integrated systems is: `https://management.region.<fqdn>/`, where `<fqdn>` is your fully qualified domain name.  
 > To retrieve the metadata required: `<ResourceManagerUrl>/metadata/endpoints?api-version=1.0`
  
 Sample JSON file:

 ```json
 {
   "galleryEndpoint": "https://portal.local.azurestack.external:30015/",  
   "graphEndpoint": "https://graph.windows.net/",  
   "portal Endpoint": "https://portal.local.azurestack.external/",
   "authentication": {
     "loginEndpoint": "https://login.windows.net/",
     "audiences": ["https://management.<yourtenant>.onmicrosoft.com/3cc5febd-e4b7-4a85-a2ed-1d730e2f5928"]
   }
 }
```

### Set environment variables

#### Microsoft Windows

To set the environment variables, use the following format in a Windows command prompt:

```shell
set AZURE_TENANT_ID=<YOUR_TENANT_ID>
```

#### macOS, Linux, and Unix-based systems

In Unix-based systems, use the following command:

```bash
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<YOUR_TENANT_ID>
```

## Existing API profiles

The **Azure_sdk** rollup gem has the following 3 profiles:

- **V2019_03_01_Hybrid**: Profile built for Azure Stack Hub. Use this profile for all the latest versions of services available in Azure Stack Hub version 1904 or later.
- **V2017_03_09**: Profile built for Azure Stack Hub. Use this profile for services to be most compatible with Azure Stack Hub version 1808 or earlier.
- **Latest**: Profile consists of the latest versions of all services. Use the latest versions of all the services.

For more info on Azure Stack Hub and API profiles, see the [Summary of API profiles](azure-stack-version-profiles.md#summary-of-api-profiles).

## Azure Ruby SDK API profile usage

Use the following code to instantiate a profile client. This parameter is only required for Azure Stack Hub or other private clouds. Global Azure already has these settings by default.

```Ruby  
active_directory_settings = get_active_directory_settings(ENV['ARM_ENDPOINT'])

provider = MsRestAzure::ApplicationTokenProvider.new(
  ENV['AZURE_TENANT_ID'],
  ENV['AZURE_CLIENT_ID'],
  ENV['AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET'],
  active_directory_settings
)
credentials = MsRest::TokenCredentials.new(provider)
options = {
  credentials: credentials,
  subscription_id: subscription_id,
  active_directory_settings: active_directory_settings,
  base_url: ENV['ARM_ENDPOINT']
}

# Target profile built for Azure Stack Hub
client = Azure::Resources::Profiles::V2019_03_01_Hybrid::Mgmt::Client.new(options)
```

The profile client can be used to access individual resource providers, such as Compute, Storage, and Network:

```Ruby  
# To access the operations associated with Compute
profile_client.compute.virtual_machines.get 'RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME', 'VIRTUAL_MACHINE_NAME'

# Option 1: To access the models associated with Compute
purchase_plan_obj = profile_client.compute.model_classes.purchase_plan.new

# Option 2: To access the models associated with Compute
# Notice Namespace: Azure::Profiles::<Profile Name>::<Service Name>::Mgmt::Models::<Model Name>
purchase_plan_obj = Azure::Profiles::V2019_03_01_Hybrid::Compute::Mgmt::Models::PurchasePlan.new
```

## Define Azure Stack Hub environment setting functions

To authenticate the service principal to the Azure Stack Hub environment, define the endpoints using `get_active_directory_settings()`. This method uses the **ARM_Endpoint** environment variable that you set previously:

```Ruby  
# Get Authentication endpoints using Arm Metadata Endpoints
def get_active_directory_settings(armEndpoint)
  settings = MsRestAzure::ActiveDirectoryServiceSettings.new
  response = Net::HTTP.get_response(URI("#{armEndpoint}/metadata/endpoints?api-version=1.0"))
  status_code = response.code
  response_content = response.body
  unless status_code == "200"
    error_model = JSON.load(response_content)
    fail MsRestAzure::AzureOperationError.new("Getting Azure Stack Hub Metadata Endpoints", response, error_model)
  end
  result = JSON.load(response_content)
  settings.authentication_endpoint = result['authentication']['loginEndpoint'] unless result['authentication']['loginEndpoint'].nil?
  settings.token_audience = result['authentication']['audiences'][0] unless result['authentication']['audiences'][0].nil?
  settings
end
```

## Samples using API profiles

Use the following samples on GitHub as references for creating solutions with Ruby and Azure Stack Hub API profiles:

- [Manage Azure resources and resource groups with Ruby](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Hybrid-Resource-Manager-Ruby-Resources-And-Groups).
- [Manage virtual machines using Ruby](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Hybrid-Compute-Ruby-Manage-VM) (Sample that uses 2019-03-01-hybrid profile to target the latest API versions supported by Azure Stack Hub).
- [Deploy an SSH Enabled VM with a Template in Ruby](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Hybrid-Resource-Manager-Ruby-Template-Deployment).

### Sample Resource Manager and groups

To run the sample, ensure that you've installed Ruby. If you're using Visual Studio Code, download the Ruby SDK extension as well.

> [!NOTE]  
> The repository for the sample is [Hybrid-Resource-Manager-Ruby-Resources-And-Groups](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Hybrid-Resource-Manager-Ruby-Resources-And-Groups).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Hybrid-Resource-Manager-Ruby-Resources-And-Groups.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using bundle:

   ```Bash
   cd Hybrid-Resource-Manager-Ruby-Resources-And-Groups
   bundle install
   ```

3. Create an Azure service principal using PowerShell and retrieve the values needed.

   For instructions on creating a service principal, see [Use Azure PowerShell to create a service principal with a certificate](../operator/azure-stack-create-service-principals.md).

   Values needed are:

   - Tenant ID
   - Client ID
   - Client secret
   - Subscription ID
   - Resource Manager endpoint

   Set the following environment variables using the information retrieved from the service principal you created:

   - `export AZURE_TENANT_ID={your tenant ID}`
   - `export AZURE_CLIENT_ID={your client ID}`
   - `export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET={your client secret}`
   - `export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID={your subscription ID}`
   - `export ARM_ENDPOINT={your Azure Stack Hub Resource Manager URL}`

   > [!NOTE]  
   > On Windows, use `set` instead of `export`.

4. Ensure the location variable is set to your Azure Stack Hub location; for example, `LOCAL="local"`.

5. To target the correct active directory endpoints, add the following line of code if you're using Azure Stack Hub or other private clouds:

   ```Ruby  
   active_directory_settings = get_active_directory_settings(ENV['ARM_ENDPOINT'])
   ```

6. In the `options` variable, add the Active Directory settings and the base URL to work with Azure Stack Hub:

   ```ruby  
   options = {
   credentials: credentials,
   subscription_id: subscription_id,
   active_directory_settings: active_directory_settings,
   base_url: ENV['ARM_ENDPOINT']
   }
   ```

7. Create a profile client that targets the Azure Stack Hub profile:

   ```ruby  
   client = Azure::Resources::Profiles::V2019_03_01_Hybrid::Mgmt::Client.new(options)
   ```

8. To authenticate the service principal with Azure Stack Hub, the endpoints should be defined using **get_active_directory_settings()**. This method uses the **ARM_Endpoint** environment variable that you set previously:

   ```ruby  
   def get_active_directory_settings(armEndpoint)
     settings = MsRestAzure::ActiveDirectoryServiceSettings.new
     response = Net::HTTP.get_response(URI("#{armEndpoint}/metadata/endpoints?api-version=1.0"))
     status_code = response.code
     response_content = response.body
     unless status_code == "200"
       error_model = JSON.load(response_content)
       fail MsRestAzure::AzureOperationError.new("Getting Azure Stack Hub Metadata Endpoints", response, error_model)
     end
     result = JSON.load(response_content)
     settings.authentication_endpoint = result['authentication']['loginEndpoint'] unless result['authentication']['loginEndpoint'].nil?
     settings.token_audience = result['authentication']['audiences'][0] unless result['authentication']['audiences'][0].nil?
     settings
   end
   ```

9. Run the sample.

   ```Ruby
   bundle exec ruby example.rb
   ```
