# Introduction to Azure Stack Hub networking

Azure Stack Hub provides different kinds of networking capabilities that can be used together or separately:

- **Connectivity between Azure Stack Hub resources**  
    Connect Azure resources together in a secure and private virtual network in the cloud.
- **Internet connectivity**  
    Communicate to and from Azure Stack Hub resources over the internet.
- **On-premises connectivity**  
    Connect an on-premises network to Azure Stack Hub resources through a virtual private network (VPN) over the internet, or through a dedicated connection to Azure Stack Hub.
- **Load balancing and traffic direction**  
    Load balance traffic to servers in the same location and direct traffic to servers in different locations.
- **Security**  
    Filter network traffic between network subnets or individual VMs.
- **Routing**  
    Use default routing or fully control routing between your Azure Stack Hub and on-premises resources.
- **Manageability**  
    Monitor and manage your Azure Stack Hub networking resources.
- **Deployment and configuration tools**  
    Use a web-based portal or cross-platform command-line tools to deploy and configure network resources.
